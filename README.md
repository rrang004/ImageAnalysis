This is an incomplete version of a script I wrote in my 2nd year of college. 

It takes in data sets (in .tif format) containing individual pictures of beads obtained from my colleague's Optical Tweezer research. 

It compares each frame to 4 separate classifications and attempts to sort them into groups according to their similarity.
